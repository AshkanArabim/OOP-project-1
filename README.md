# OOP-project-1
Group assignment for Dr. Gurijala's spring 24 object-oriented-programming class.

## JavaDoc
- Docs are not added to github because they can be generated with the `javadoc -d JavaDoc *.java` command (or whatever your IDE has; Just make sure it's saved in the `JavaDoc` directory). **DON'T commit javadoc files with your code.** I'll revert your commit if yo do so. We'll generate those on demand locally when we need to submit.

## Running the project
- `cd src`
- `javac *.java`
- `java RunShop`
